guess the number python game


Here's how the game works:

The random module is used to generate a random number between 1 and 100.
The user is asked to guess a number between 1 and 100.
A while loop is used to keep asking the user to guess until they get the correct number.
If the user's guess is too low, the program prints "Too low!" and asks the user to guess again.
If the user's guess is too high, the program prints "Too high!" and asks the user to guess again.
When the user finally guesses the correct number, the program prints "Congratulations, you guessed the number!"
